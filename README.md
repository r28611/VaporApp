# Shopping App Backend

Welcome to my study project: **backend built with Swift and Vapor** for the Shopping iOS App, and deployed on Heroku.

This backend server is designed to support the Shopping App, providing the necessary APIs and services to enable a seamless shopping experience for users. The server is implemented using the Swift programming language and the Vapor framework.

- RESTful API: The backend exposes a set of RESTful APIs to handle various operations such as user authentication, product listing, shopping cart management, and more.
- Heroku Deployment: The application is deployed on Heroku, a cloud platform that ensures scalability and reliability.
